# Car-Rental-program
This program's foundation lies on nested "If, else" statements within a While loop. It consists of 3 monetary budget modes: Budget, Daily, and Weekly; each with their own set pricing. All take into account the number of miles driven and the number of days rented. It will print out a summary of the customer's transaction, including the odometer at the start of the transaction, the odometer at the end of the transaction, and the total cost of the transaction. This program will detect wether the Starting odometer is greater than the ending Odometer, and will adjust it to the real number of miles driven. 
Example: Starting: 999,056 Odometer Miles. 
           Ending:  000,406 Odometer Miles.
            Total:  1350.0 Odometer Miles
       Real Miles:  135.0 Miles

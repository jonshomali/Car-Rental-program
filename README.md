# Car-Rental-program
This program's foundation lies on nested "If, else" statements within a While loop. It consists of 3 monetary budget modes: Budget, Daily, and Weekly; each with their own set pricing. All take into account the number of miles driven and the number of days rented. It will print out a summary of the customer's transaction, including the odometer at the start of the transaction, the odometer at the end of the transaction, and the total cost of the transaction.
